This is an reimplementation of the Open311 Georeport API (starting with v2) in [Swagger 2.0](http://swagger.io) syntax. This design is a colloberation of the community and development is discussed at [mailing list](http://lists.open311.org/groups/discuss).

The definition is **work in progress** !

Currently: ![syntax check](http://online.swagger.io/validator?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open311/swagger-open311/master/open311-georeporter.yaml)

I also addedd markups to indicate possible malformed/undefined/... areas

* `#todo` indicates possible work esp. at syntax
